This is the project I created for my final paper (TCC).

The idea is to provide a Web Application where the user can register their expenses with subscriptions.
With all the data gathered, the application will provide a feature that will compare each other's expenses and it will warn the user that is paying more for a subscription compared with the others.
For example: If a user is paying R$ 150,00 for an internet plan that provides 100mb and the majority of users pay only R$ 110,00, a warning will be sent so that the user can negotiate with the company.
